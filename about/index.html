    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>Welcome! My name is Pepyn Swagemakers and I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science from Linnaeus University. </p>

    <p>Besides my studies I work as an ICT administrator for a cluster of elementary schools in Gothenburg. My job entails devising and
        implementing an IT strategy, ranging from ensuring adequate infrastructure to helping teaching staff use technology in a way that enhances
        their pupils' learning experience.</p>

    <p> On an operational level this means planning lessons together with teachers, making sure all equipment (including 500-ish iPads)
        is functional, managing login and passwords, and managing several support systems for administrative and scheduling purposes. I also
        teach a programming class as an elective for our students, where they can learn more about how computers work and build their own programs using
        Scratch. In these classes I try to combine the digital with the physical, using tools like Makey Makey to program real life objects (banana piano, anyone?).
        We have also worked together with Chalmers University of Technology, where our pupils have visited to learn more about engineering studies.</p>

    <p>When not working or studying I enjoy cooking, reading, and being outside. I try to live an active lifestyle and work out several times a week,
        with activities ranging from trail running to mountain biking, swimming and hiking. I am also an avid surfer and try to get out in the waves as often as
        possible, even in the extremely cold conditions of Swedish winter.</p>

    <h2>About the site</h2>

    <p>This website was created as an assignment for the course 1DV022 - Client Side Programming
        at Linnaeus University.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this site is to serve as a portfolio for the course work and also to learn about using static site generators and CSS preprocessors.
        The tools used in this case are Jekyll and SASS, hosted on Github Pages. Development was done on a virtual Vagrant machine.</p>
