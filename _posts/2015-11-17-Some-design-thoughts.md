For this project one of the requirements was for the site to be "well designed". Since good design is of course subject to
discussion, I focused on a simple design with focus on content. In my opinion this would be most suited for a portfolio / blog type
project.

Most of my inspiration came from Google's new effort on [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html), which focuses on
"synthesizing the classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science". This is 
manifested in a design that tries to visualize real life materials: surfaces and edges, a sense of space and motion. Use of bold
colors as well as intentional whitespace are used to accomplish design goals.

Another important criterion in the design was for it to look great on mobile, as more and more visitors to websites use mobile
devices like phones and tablets. As luck would have it, much of this is already built into Jekyll so regardless of how the user
 reaches this site, it should be a pleasant experience.
